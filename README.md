# RPG-Presentation
This repository (essentially the README file) represents my RPG game project and its evolution. This project is private but its activity is still visible on my profile. The project's code is now on stand by, the priority now is to find out the sotry telling of the game. I'll write it down but not here, not on GitHub.
